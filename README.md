# calculator-project
**General Info**

In this project, prompted by the Odin Project self-pace course, I created a basic calculator with a dynamic display.

This project was admittedly much more difficult than I anticipated because a calculator seems like such a simple tool. What helped the most with this project was proper planning before even beginning to write code. I outlined a general idea of what functions I needed to create (i.e delete function), how I planned on actually building the calculator visually speaking, and the flow of my overall code. 

The most challenging part for me, was making sure that that the decimal point worked as expected. I was able to overcome this issue by creating the getDisplayNumber function and splitting up the user's input, turning it into and array and using the decimal point to split it.
